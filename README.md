# Password Generator
For this project I have chosen to make a simple password generator. 

This application will select between 8 and 128 characters from an array in a random order. These characters can include or exclude uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

The user will be asked before password generation:

* How many characters will be in the password.
* Will they use uppercase letters.
* Will they use lowercase letters.
* Will there be numbers.
* Will there be symbols.

As long as one or more of these parameters are selected, a random password will be created.
